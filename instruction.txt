- If the file/folder that's needed to be backed up is in a different folder
with the backup.py/restore.py files, an absolute path of the file/folder must be 
passed in order to locate the file/folder location.

- If the file/folder that's needed to be backed up is in the same folder with the backup.py/restore.py
files, only the folder/file name needed to be passed. If there are spaces within the file/folder name,
put the name inside quotation marks.

- Empty folders should not exist.
